# PayFleens
PayFleens is a UCI/EXBOARD Chess Engine forked from Vice by Bluefever (Really I was learning C with Bluefever Youtube series)

Compile using this command if you have gcc or g++ compiler
`g++ xboard.c PayFleens.c uci.c evaluate.c pvtable.c init.c bitboards.c hashkeys.c board.c data.c attack.c io.c movegen.c validate.c makemove.c perft.c search.c misc.c -o PayFleens -O2 -s`

Enjoy and have fun :)
